T4TemplateManager
=================


This program is a tool to manage T$ template for code gneration. It has some built in support for database access which allows you to pass a list of fields for a table or the list of tables in a database to your templates. This gives the ability to generate some nifty things like data access objects, stored procedures, MVC views and anything else you can think of. You can also use regular templates that odn't require data access. The program will parse out the parameters in key value format and put them in the parameters window for you to fill out.

Stay tuned. I hope to make this robust and add support for more database systems and other languages.
